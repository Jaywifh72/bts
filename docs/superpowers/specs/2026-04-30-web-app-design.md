# Web App Design — Global Cinematic Technical Repository (v1)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-04-30 |
| **Status** | Approved |
| **Parent project** | Global Cinematic Technical Repository: Master Development Blueprint |
| **Sub-project** | 2 of 6 — Public Web App |
| **Predecessor** | Sub-project 1 — Data Layer (`packages/db`) |
| **Successor** | Sub-project 3 — Search & Discovery |

---

## 1. Context

### 1.1 What this sub-project is

Sub-project 2 delivers the public read-only web application that surfaces the data layer built in sub-project 1. It is a statically generated Next.js App Router application that imports the typed Drizzle query layer from `@bts/db` directly — no HTTP API boundary.

The app has a working name of **Studio Pro**. It is positioned as a professional reference tool, not an editorial or discovery magazine.

### 1.2 Anchor audience

Working professionals — DPs, gaffers, ACs, colorists, VFX supervisors. The same audience the data layer was designed for. A pro will arrive knowing a production title, a person's name, or a piece of gear, and expect to find dense, cited, accurate data immediately. The UI must signal "made for us" within three seconds.

### 1.3 Scope for this sub-project

**In scope:**
- Static read-only web app: production detail, person detail, equipment detail pages
- Browse/index pages for each entity type
- Three killer query pages matching the data layer's regression contract
- Dark, data-dense visual design system (Tailwind, no component library)
- Source attribution display on every entity

**Explicitly out of scope (per master blueprint):**
- Text search UI (sub-project 3 — Algolia / pg_trgm)
- Faceted filtering (thin wrapper over search; deferred to sub-project 3)
- Auth, subscriptions (sub-project 6)
- Admin / editorial UI (sub-project 4 or 5)
- Interactive components, media assets (sub-project 5)
- Write paths of any kind

## 2. Decisions (Q&A log)

| # | Question | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Primary entry point | **Production-first** | DPs arrive in prep knowing a film title. Productions surface crew, formats, and gear in one place — the richest node. Equipment cross-reference is the differentiating sticky feature. |
| D2 | Scope | **Read-only browse + killer query pages, no search** | Seed corpus (~15-20 productions) is too small for a search box to add value. Search is sub-project 3. |
| D3 | Visual register | **Dark, technical, data-dense** | Working pros live in Resolve/Frame.io/Silverstack — all dark. Signals "made for us." Differentiates from Letterboxd/IMDb in the light/editorial lane. |
| D4 | Page inventory | **Full detail pages for productions, people, manufacturers, series, items. Scenes inline.** | Killer query results link to entity detail pages — stubs break the loop that keeps a pro engaged. Scenes have no standalone URL use case at this stage. |
| D5 | Data fetching | **React Server Components query `@bts/db` directly** | No external consumers at this stage; RSC eliminates round-trip overhead; typed Drizzle layer already captures type-safety; Route Handlers can be added later. |
| D6 | Framework | **Next.js 14+ App Router** | Static generation is a genuine win for read-only data. App Router layout nesting maps cleanly to gear URL hierarchy. TypeScript/pnpm monorepo already in place. Natural foundation for sub-projects 5 and 6. |

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Repo placement

```
bts/                          ← pnpm workspace root (C:\dev\bts)
├── packages/
│   └── db/                   ← @bts/db (sub-project 1, complete)
└── apps/
    └── web/                  ← @bts/web (this sub-project)
        ├── app/
        ├── components/
        ├── lib/
        ├── public/
        ├── next.config.ts
        ├── tailwind.config.ts
        ├── package.json
        └── tsconfig.json
```

`apps/web/package.json` declares `"@bts/db": "workspace:*"` as a dependency. The web app imports the typed Drizzle `db` instance and query functions directly — no HTTP boundary.

### 3.2 Rendering strategy

**Fully static.** `generateStaticParams` walks every slug at build time and pre-renders all detail pages. The killer query pages bake their results in at build time too. At runtime, zero DB connections are made — pages are served as flat HTML from a CDN edge. `next build` is rerun whenever the seed data changes.

A broken slug in `generateStaticParams` fails the build rather than silently serving a runtime 404. This is intentional — it makes data integrity problems visible in CI.

**Slug sourcing:** Slugs are hardcoded in seed data files (`packages/db/src/seed/data/*.ts`), loaded into the DB by the seed runner, and read back from the DB by `generateStaticParams`. The web app never generates or transforms slugs itself. The data layer spec (§4.1) defines the slug format: kebab-case, lowercase, ASCII-only, year-suffix on collision.

**DB access model:** Query functions are called server-side only (in RSC and `generateStaticParams`). `DATABASE_URL` is provided via `.env.local` (git-ignored). No client-side DB access. No row-level security required for v1 (fully read-only, statically generated). Access model is audited before adding auth in sub-project 6.

### 3.3 Query layer convention

All DB queries live in `packages/db/src/queries/`, organized by entity. Each file exports typed async functions that accept a `db` instance and return plain objects — no Drizzle internal types leak into `apps/web`. New query files added for the web app:

```
packages/db/src/queries/
  killer-queries.ts        ← exists: findFeaturesShotOnAlexa65WithSphero(),
                                      findLensesByDpOnProduction(), findMagicHourExteriorLightingByYear()
  productions.ts           ← listProductions(), getProductionBySlug(), getProductionWithFullDetail()
  people.ts                ← listPeople(), getPersonBySlug(), getPersonFilmography()
  equipment.ts             ← listManufacturers(), getManufacturerBySlug(),
                              getSeriesBySlug(), getItemBySlug(),
                              getProductionsUsingItem()
```

**Scene queries:** Scenes are never fetched as standalone entities. They are always loaded as part of `getProductionWithFullDetail()`, which returns a production with its scenes and equipment usage inline. No `getSceneBySlug()` function exists or is needed — scenes have no standalone URL.

**Spec schemas import:** `SpecsTable.tsx` imports Zod schemas from `packages/db/src/schema/specs/` via a `"./schema/specs"` subpath export in `packages/db/package.json`. This export must be added to the data layer package's `exports` map as part of the data layer's setup for this sub-project (it is not yet present — adding it is a task in the implementation plan). The Zod schema per equipment category (lens, camera, lighting, filter) is used to parse and validate the JSONB `specs` field before rendering. Unknown keys outside the schema are rendered in a catch-all "other specs" row — they are not discarded.

**Killer query function names:** The three functions in `packages/db/src/queries/killer-queries.ts` are `findFeaturesShotOnAlexa65WithSphero(db)`, `findLensesByDpOnProduction(db, personSlug, productionSlug)`, and `findMagicHourExteriorLightingByYear(db, year)`. These names are confirmed in the data layer implementation and are the exact identifiers the killer query pages import.

Query functions are called directly from `async` Server Components. No `fetch()`, no Route Handlers, no client-side data loading.

---

## 4. URL Structure & Page Inventory

**14 routes total.**

### 4.1 Browse / index pages

```
/                              Homepage: featured productions grid + killer query links
/films                         All productions, sorted by release year desc
/crew                          All people, sorted by family name
/gear                          Manufacturer index
/gear/[manufacturer]           Series list for a manufacturer
```

### 4.2 Detail pages (generateStaticParams per slug)

```
/films/[slug]                                    Production detail
/crew/[slug]                                     Person detail
/gear/[manufacturer]/[series]                    Series detail
/gear/[manufacturer]/[series]/[item]             Item detail
```

Every detail route exports a `generateStaticParams` function. The query used to populate each:

| Route | generateStaticParams calls |
|---|---|
| `/films/[slug]` | `listProductions(db)` → returns `{ slug }[]` |
| `/crew/[slug]` | `listPeople(db)` → returns `{ slug }[]` |
| `/gear/[manufacturer]` | `listManufacturers(db)` → returns `{ slug }[]` |
| `/gear/[manufacturer]/[series]` | `listManufacturers(db)` then for each, fetch series → returns `{ manufacturer, series }[]` |
| `/gear/[manufacturer]/[series]/[item]` | Nested: manufacturers → series → items → returns `{ manufacturer, series, item }[]` |

The gear hierarchy uses a single `generateStaticParams` per segment level (Next.js evaluates each `[param]` level independently). Alternatively, the deepest level (`[item]`) can emit all ancestor slugs in one flat call — either approach is valid; the implementation plan resolves this.

### 4.3 Killer query pages (statically generated, data baked in at build)

```
/queries/alexa65-sphero           Q1: Features shot on ALEXA 65 + Panavision Sphero, by DP
/queries/dune-part-two-lenses     Q2: Lenses Greig Fraser used on Dune: Part Two
/queries/magic-hour-2023          Q3: Magic-hour exterior lighting in 2023 features
```

These pages are **not parameterized**. Each page calls its corresponding function with hardcoded arguments and bakes the results into a static HTML table at build time.

**Q1 — `/queries/alexa65-sphero`**
- Calls `findFeaturesShotOnAlexa65WithSphero(db)` (no arguments; slug filters are hardcoded inside the function).
- Renders a `KillerQueryTable` with columns: **Production** (linked to `/films/[slug]`), **Year**, **DP** (linked to `/crew/[slug]`).
- Row data shape: `{ title, slug, release_year, dp_name, dp_slug }`.
- Sorted by DP name ascending (per the function's `ORDER BY`).

**Q2 — `/queries/dune-part-two-lenses`**
- Calls `findLensesByDpOnProduction(db, 'greig-fraser', 'dune-part-two')` (slugs hardcoded in the page).
- Renders a `KillerQueryTable` with columns: **Lens Series** (linked to `/gear/[manufacturer]/[series]`), **Item** (linked to `/gear/[manufacturer]/[series]/[item]` when known, otherwise `—`).
- Row data shape: `{ series_slug, series_name, item_slug, item_name }`.

**Q3 — `/queries/magic-hour-2023`**
- Calls `findMagicHourExteriorLightingByYear(db, 2023)` (year hardcoded in the page).
- Renders a `KillerQueryTable` with columns: **Production** (linked), **Scene**, **Lighting Series** (linked), **Item** (linked when known).
- Row data shape: `{ title, slug, scene_title, lighting_series, lighting_item }`.

All three pages share a page header (`SectionHeader`) that describes the query in plain English, and a `KillerQueryTable` that renders the result set.

### 4.4 Utility

```
/not-found                         Next.js not-found.tsx (404)
```

### 4.5 Navigation

Persistent top nav with three primary anchors — **Films**, **Crew**, **Gear** — plus a **Queries** link. The gear URL hierarchy (`/gear/[manufacturer]/[series]/[item]`) is reflected in a breadcrumb bar rendered by `app/gear/layout.tsx`.

Scenes have no standalone URL — they render inline within `/films/[slug]` as an expandable section listing equipment per scene.

---

## 5. Component Architecture

### 5.1 Server vs. client split

All components are Server Components by default. A component becomes a Client Component only if it requires `useState`, `useEffect`, event handlers, or browser APIs.

The one exception is `SourceCitation.tsx`, which uses the HTML5 `<details>/<summary>` element for collapsible citation disclosure. This requires no JavaScript and no Client Component — `<details>` is a native browser disclosure widget that works without JS and resets on page navigation. No `useState` or `'use client'` directive is needed.

### 5.2 Layout nesting

```
app/layout.tsx            Root HTML shell, dark background, top nav (Server Component)
app/gear/layout.tsx       Breadcrumb bar reflecting manufacturer → series → item depth
```

### 5.3 Component inventory

```
components/
  nav/
    TopNav.tsx                     Persistent navigation bar
  productions/
    ProductionCard.tsx             Card for /films grid
    ProductionDetail.tsx           Full detail layout for /films/[slug]
    SceneList.tsx                  Scenes + inline equipment for a production
    FormatBadge.tsx                Single production_format row rendered as a pill showing aspect_ratio + acquisition_format.
                                   ProductionCard passes the primary format (is_primary=true).
                                   ProductionDetail passes all formats as a vertical stack (one badge per row).
  people/
    PersonCard.tsx                 Card for /crew grid
    FilmographyTable.tsx           Production list for /crew/[slug]
  equipment/
    ManufacturerCard.tsx           Card for /gear index
    SpecsTable.tsx                 Renders JSONB specs by category shape (uses Zod schemas from @bts/db)
  queries/
    KillerQueryTable.tsx           Shared table component for all three killer query pages
  ui/
    DataTable.tsx                  Dark-themed table primitive (reused across all entities)
    Badge.tsx                      Pill: confidence level / equipment category / production type
    SectionHeader.tsx              Amber left-border rule + label + heading
    SourceCitation.tsx             Disclosure block using HTML5 <details>/<summary> (no JS required).
                                   Trigger text: "N source(s)" with confidence badge. Expanded: full
                                   citation with title, publication, author, date, URL, confidence badge,
                                   and optional claim_quote.
```

### 5.4 Attribution display

Every production, scene, crew assignment, and equipment usage row surfaces its `_sources` rows as collapsible citation footnotes using `SourceCitation`. The disclosure widget is an HTML5 `<details>/<summary>` element — no JS, no Client Component. The `confidence` enum drives a visual badge:

| Confidence | Badge style |
|---|---|
| `primary` | White pill |
| `secondary` | Zinc-400 pill |
| `manufacturer_marketing` | Amber-400 pill with warning icon |
| `speculative` | Dashed border, zinc-500 text |

---

## 6. Visual Design System

### 6.1 Palette

| Role | Token | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| Page canvas | `zinc-950` | `#09090b` |
| Surface (cards, panels) | `zinc-900` | `#18181b` |
| Border / divider | `zinc-800` | `#27272a` |
| Text primary | `zinc-50` | `#fafafa` |
| Text muted | `zinc-400` | `#a1a1aa` |
| Accent | `amber-400` | `#fbbf24` |
| Danger | `rose-500` | `#f43f5e` |

Amber is the single accent. It reads as a technical indicator (on-set monitors, warning LEDs) rather than a decorative color, and pairs with near-black without the coldness of cyan or blue.

### 6.2 Typography

| Use | Font | Loading |
|---|---|---|
| UI / data / labels | `Inter` | `next/font/google` |
| Display / film titles / person names | `DM Serif Display` | `next/font/google` |

One serif + one sans-serif. `DM Serif Display` gives production titles editorial weight without making the layout feel like a magazine. Both are self-hosted via `next/font` for zero layout shift.

### 6.3 Density targets

- Data table rows: `text-sm` (14px), 36px row height, `px-3 py-2` cell padding — matches Resolve inspector density.
- Cards: 4–6 productions visible per viewport at 1440px without scrolling.
- No hero images, no decorative full-bleed photography. Film titles are typographic.

### 6.4 Component primitives

All built with Tailwind utility classes. No component library (no shadcn, no Radix) — the UI is read-only with no interactive widgets beyond navigation links.

| Primitive | Description |
|---|---|
| `DataTable` | `zinc-900` background, `zinc-800` borders, `odd:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-950` zebra striping |
| `Badge` | Pill-shaped, one variant per confidence level, equipment category, and production type |
| `SectionHeader` | Amber left-border rule + `zinc-400` label + `zinc-50` heading |
| `SourceCitation` | `text-xs`, muted. HTML5 `<details>/<summary>` disclosure. Trigger shows count + highest-confidence badge. Expanded body shows full citation fields. |

---

## 7. Error Handling

**404:** `notFound()` called from any Server Component when a slug lookup returns null. A single `app/not-found.tsx` renders a dark-themed not-found page with a link back to `/films`.

**Build-time slug safety:** `generateStaticParams` failures abort the build. A bad slug is a data problem, caught in CI, not a runtime 404 in production.

**Unexpected errors:** A single `app/error.tsx` catches unexpected Server Component errors. No per-route error boundaries — the data is read-only and query failures are rare.

**Environment:** `DATABASE_URL` loaded from `.env.local` (git-ignored) at dev and build time. Reuses the same variable name as `packages/db/.env`. The DB user requires read access to all tables; no row-level security policies are needed for v1 (fully static, no user sessions). Auth and RLS are addressed in sub-project 6.

---

## 8. Testing

| Layer | Tool | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| Type checking | `tsc --noEmit` | Query result type mismatches, schema changes that break the web app |
| Build smoke | `next build` | Broken `generateStaticParams`, missing slugs, render errors |
| No component unit tests | — | Components are thin wrappers over typed data; no logic to unit-test |

CI sequence (addition to existing):
```
db:migrate → db:seed → tsc --noEmit (web) → next build
```

End-to-end tests (Playwright) are deferred to sub-projects 5–6 when user interaction flows exist.

1. Spec review (separate agent verifies completeness and consistency).
2. User reviews this document.
3. Invoke writing-plans skill — produces a task-by-task implementation plan.
4. Implement against the plan in `apps/web`.
